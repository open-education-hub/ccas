# Introduction

This is a landing page for the `CCAS` (Computing and Calculus for Advanced Statistics) course.
Here you will find all the documentation needed for this course.
It is meant to be used by teachers, trainers, students and hobbyists who want to learn about topics on calculus and statistics.

The course is structured in chapters, each with their own sections.
Each section presents a particular topic, rich in examples.
There is a sizeable focus on the use of the [R programming language for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/) for demonstrating the topics in a practical manner.

Chapters are:

- [Numbers to Indices](../numbers-to-indices/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Functions](../functions/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Multivariate to Power](../multivariate-to-power/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Vectors to Some Regression Topics](../vectors-matrix-ops/overview/reading/read.md)
